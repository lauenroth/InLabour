# InLabour

This is the app you need when you are in labour. 

## Features

* Track your contractions
* See your past contractions and filter them
* Check the average duration and frequency and get a warning when you should go to the hospital
* Create a ToDo list with the last few things you have to remember when you are in labour, e.g. "call the midwife".
* Prepare a list with phone numbers you might need to call (e.g. taxi service, hospital,...) - so you don't need to search for them when you have other things on your mind.


## Targeted devices
The app is optimized for smartphones but will also work on tablets, desktops or basically any device with a halfway decent browser.
