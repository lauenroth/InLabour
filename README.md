# InLabour

InLabour is an app where you can track contractions when you are in labour.
Furthermore, you can create a todo list with things you need to do before the baby will be born (e.g. call the midwife, pack ID, ...) and a contact list with important phone numbers (e.g. taxi, hospital, midwife).

The app is optimized for smartphones but will also work on tablets, desktops or any device with a halfway decent browser.
